# Laser-target-game
Combine binary counting and laser pointer skills while checking progress on a web page spawned by an local Wi-Fi hotspot.. nice for CTF events :+1:
This was created in order to have some fun at a CTF event. 

It involves some Laser Detector diodes, wire, and a ESP-12E.. which is nicely packaged in a Lolin NodeMCU V3 board (currently shipped free of charge to Europe for 1,94 euro.. wow). 
To provide output to the users there is also an OLED involved.

The diodes are mounted on an electrical pipe of about one meter. 
Distance between audiance and targets may vary upon taste but 7 meters is quite a challenge :-)
